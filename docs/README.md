- Drag-and-drop widgets
- Calculate and display this trend: for a user, what days had increasing steps for 3 or more days

## Milestones
- We cultivated a wonderful team dynamic based on well planned and thought out approaches. 
- We engineered an API integration while negotiating each others thoughts, ideas and feelings.
- We each navigated through any potentially arising issues with an empathetic team mentality and daily EOD retros to discuss any issues or needs.

## Challenges 
- Remaining open and willing to hear each other out. We managed this by referring back to our DTR each day.
- Staying in the present and not rushing ahead in our work despite our deadline. We laid out a very thoughout map that we utilized to avoid these pitfalls.
- The API was even more challenging than any of us anticipated. But due to the constant contact with our DTR we able to properly identify when we got stuck in a rabbit hole and how to get out of it.
