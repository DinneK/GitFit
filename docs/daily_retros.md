# Daily Retros



### Saturday 08/27/22
- We created the `pull_request_template.md` file and added it to our `.github/ ` directory.

- PLANNING:
     - We went over the importance of breaking down a project down to it's features. 
     - Dinne also showed us the ways in which we will have to link our `Github Projects` organizer to our repository and structure it with the following in mind:
         - How to create a ticket system based on the iterations and its sub categories. We will need to be specific about what each feature/code implementaton we will want to divide into its own ticket.

     - We are breaking down the JSON data information in order to figure out what data we need to work out 
     Heorku Appwill not be hosting free app deployment services anymore

- Challenges:
     - Dinne: 
     - Matt:
     - Dani: 
- Wins:
     - Dinne: 
     - Matt:
     - Dani: 


### Sunday 08/28/22

- Today we completed the `User.js' 'UserRepository.js` `Hydration.js`class designs for our issue tickets.
- We also started talking about data delegation as well as class-to-class communication.

To Do's for Monday ddliverable
We will need to finish our project board:
- finish the sleep class
- we will need to finish our iteration 2 - fetch calls
- Think about eberything that goes into our index.js (connecting our classes)
- starting our html layout
- explore Chat.js so that we can propose this feature use to Cass
- We need to start creating our mock data sets.
- include Matt in the duscussion about delegating tasks - this mod will push more for 'divide and conquer' coding
- Talk to our mentors about how we can best delegate class responsibilities, as well as assign data sets to an object class.

- Challenges:
     - Dinne: 
     - Matt:
     - Dani: 
- Wins:
     - Dinne: 
     - Matt:
     - Dani: 



### Monday 08/29/22

- We created the `mockUserData.js`, `mockHydrationData.js`, `mockSleepData.js`
- We also created the the `User.js`, `UserHydration.js` and the `UserRepository.js` class.
- Along with the classes we created our constructors and our test files to accompany the classes.



- Challenges:
     - Dinne: 'This is slower than I thought it would go. I'm Finding it challenging to actually type out the implementation that we talked out loud as a group during our preplanning."
     - Matt: "Making my idea on my head match the idea on paper. Took a while to lean into the actual planning we created. It was a challenge to actually walk down the path we have set out for ourselves when created the map"
     - Dani: On a personal level, my biggest challenge was dealing with the personal thoughts that held me from focus. On the technical end, the challenge is understanding how to handle big data sets. "We are handling big datasets for class, and will most definitely have to out in the real world, so how exactly do we delegate the data for optimal 'reach' and access?"
- Wins:
     - Dinne: Excited for how far we have gotten with actually understanding our roadmap, and how well we work together.
     - Matt: "However, the challenge is also the reward. We have an actual map that we can follow!"
     - Dani: "My biggest win is feeling excited to work with this team! We tried out dividing and conquering today and I think that it worked out well. We were all in the same breakout room and we were able to check in on each other."

- To Do Tomorrow:
     - We have to finish our `User.js`, `UserRepository.js` and `Hydration.js` classes
     - Start our `Sleep.js` class.
     - Finsih our tentative wireframe
     

### Tuesday 08/30/22
- Today we created 

- Challenges:
     - Dinne: "Sticking to the poms today."
     - Matt: "I feel like I lost total scope on 'something', but everything worked out. we're still on the general path." 
     - Dani: "My challenge was not getting too ahead of myself with preplanning."
- Wins:
     - Dinne: "I was able to build two methods without any outside help! First time I was able to write my own code in a group setting. I feel like I have been able to write down my own ideas and to implement my own code. It doesn't feel like I'm blindfolded and throwing darts at a dartboard. My coding feels that much more intentional."
     - Matt: "Just how quick I was able to build the function and build the user class! I never actually done the test driven dev on my own without looking at previous work I've done."
     - Dani: "being able to voice my concerns about our class-to-class communication and come to an understanding with my team. As I'm writing out the `UserRepository` class, I noticed that data sets would have to get passsed through either the `User` class or the `UserRepository` class, but the wording on the project spec is not clear. this led me down a path of "what ifs', which I honestly would not have stepped out of if it wasn't for communicating this to my team. We were able to come to an understanding where we were all able to get an even clearer picture of the finished product."

- To do tomorrow:
     - Finish UserREspository
     - Matt and Dani will start `Sleep.js` class
     - Dinne will work on the wireframe 


### Wednesday 08/31/22
- Today we created
     - `Sleep` Class
          - findUserSleepData
          - findWeeklyData method
          - getDataFromDate method
          - testing for these two methods.
     - `HTML`, `CSS`, `Script` files
          - scripts 
               - started our event listeners and our setup which includes our query selectors
               - renderWelcomeMessage method 
               - renderUserInfo method
               - render RandomUser 
               - returnStepGoalComparision() method
     - `UserREspository` class
          - return user's friends ids method
          - return usersFriendsNames method

- Challenges:
     - Dinne: Challenge today was to construct the  data to the DOM. Another getting the ids to match the friends names display the friends names. One thing That I want to put into practice is something that I learned from last mod, and that is to know when to stop when I come across a problem, specifically when its coming close to the end of the day. My instructor from last mod, Heather, suggessted that it's okay to step away from a problem when I spend so much time on it, I just need to remember to write down where I left off and pick it up the next day.
     - Matt: Today's challenge was implementing the reduce iterator to the `Sleep` class.
     - Dani: learning how to implement multiple iterators to work with each other. 'Chain iterating'. 
- Wins:
     - Dinne: beginning to feel just how much fun coding is. I got a lot done today.
     - Matt: I feel like I had a lot of small victories. it culminated in me creating such useful functionality, and it makes me feel like I got a lot accomplished. 
     - Dani: Biggest win is learning about Turnary operators! I was able to do research and reach out to my mentor about using this in my code, and it turned out to be a useful implementation.

### Thursday 09/01/22

- Challenges:
     - Dinne: "Being able to stop when I hit a code blind spot. More importantly, being able to stop for a day and get some sleep."
     - Matt: "This was my first real exposure to API and it was a whlole lot, but I was able to keep up with it! This was a whole new foundation for me and it was awesome!
     - Dani: double checking that I am following the organization we set from the very beginning. I felt Like I deviated from the project specs and did not make sure that I was implementing the right functionalities. We created the methods for the sleep class in the beginning, but the wording was so off from the project spec that I created the wrong method, which sparked a need to go back and reorganize."

- Wins:
     - Dinne: "The fact that we worked as a team and figured out the fetch calls; Being able to finish the fetch implementation and beginning to understand it 'that' much more."
     - Matt: being able to map out how some of these cross-function interactions were going, and I cannjust see it now. The class-to-class is starting to be in alignment. Also, being able to re-implement iterators to new methods."
     - Dani: Hive Minding the fetch flow and being able to follow the logic for this implementation. I felt like we all actually worked out as a team in understanding the fetch/API implementation, and our thought processes were not stepping over anyone elses' toes. We all were able to voice our opinions and ideas, and acted on them, without stepping over anyone! That's a big win!
