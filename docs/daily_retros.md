# Daily Retros



### Saturday 08/27/22
- We created the `pull_request_template.md` file and added it to our `.github/ ` directory.

- PLANNING:
     - We went over the importance of breaking down a project down to it's features. 
     - Dinne also showed us the ways in which we will have to link our `Github Projects` organizer to our repository and structure it with the following in mind:
         - How to create a ticket system based on the iterations and its sub categories. We will need to be specific about what each feature/code implementaton we will want to divide into its own ticket.

     - We are breaking down the JSON data information in order to figure out what data we need to work out 
     Heorku Appwill not be hosting free app deployment services anymore
