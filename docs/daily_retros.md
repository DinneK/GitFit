# Daily Retros



### Saturday 08/27/22
- We created the `pull_request_template.md` file and added it to our `.github/ ` directory.

- PLANNING:
     - We went over the importance of breaking down a project down to it's features. 
     - Dinne also showed us the ways in which we will have to link our `Github Projects` organizer to our repository and structure it with the following in mind:
         - How to create a ticket system based on the iterations and its sub categories. We will need to be specific about what each feature/code implementaton we will want to divide into its own ticket.

     - We are breaking down the JSON data information in order to figure out what data we need to work out 
     Heorku Appwill not be hosting free app deployment services anymore

### Sunday 08/28/22

- Today we completed the `User.js' 'UserRepository.js` `Hydration.js`class designs for our issue tickets.
- We also started talking about data delegation as well as class-to-class communication.

To Do's for Monday ddliverable
We will need to finish our project board:
- finish the sleep class
- we will need to finish our iteration 2 - fetch calls
- Think about eberything that goes into our index.js (connecting our classes)
- starting our html layout
- explore Chat.js so that we can propose this feature use to Cass
- We need to start creating our mock data sets.
- include Matt in the duscussion about delegating tasks - this mod will push more for 'divide and conquer' coding
- Talk to our mentors about how we can best delegate class responsibilities, as well as assign data sets to an object class.

### Monday 08/29/22

- We created the `mockUserData.js`, `mockHydrationData.js`, `mockSleepData.js`
- We also created the the `User.js`, `UserHydration.js` and the `UserRepository.js` class.
- Along with the classes we created our constructors and our test files to accompany the classes.



- Challenges:
     - Dinne: 'This is slower than I thought it would go. I'm Finding it challenging to actually type out the implementation that we talked out loud as a group during our preplanning."
     - Matt: "Making my idea on my head match the idea on paper. Took a while to lean into the actual planning we created. It was a challenge to actually walk down the path we have set out for ourselves when created the map"
     - Dani: On a personal level, my biggest challenge was dealing with the personal thoughts that held me from focus. On the technical end, the challenge is understanding how to handle big data sets. "We are handling big datasets for class, and will most definitely have to out in the real world, so how exactly do we delegate the data for optimal 'reach' and access?"
- Wins:
     - Dinne: Excited for how far we have gotten with actually understanding our roadmap, and how well we work together.
     - Matt: "However, the challenge is also the reward. We have an actual map that we can follow!"
     - Dani: "My biggest win is feeling excited to work with this team! We tried out dividing and conquering today and I think that it worked out well. We were all in the same breakout room and we were able to check in on each other."

- To Do Tomorrow:
     - We have to finish our `User.js`, `UserRepository.js` and `Hydration.js` classes
     - Start our `Sleep.js` class.
     - Finsih our tentative wireframe
